## Django Project test
This is a test project to learn Django. It is a simple blog application with a few features. 
I added a superuser with the following credentials:
>- username: gvantsa
>- password: gvantsa123
>- email: gvantsa@django.com  

The project is still in development(I am trying to add personal user interface with bootstrap5) and will be updated 
as I learn more about Django.

### Requirements
The modules you will need to run the project are listed in the requirements.txt file.   
You can install them by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
